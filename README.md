# data-science-portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects for academic purpose, worked as a team.
### 1. Machine Learning & Visualization (Python)
  
- **[Empirical_Asset_Pricing_using_Machine_Learning](https://github.com/hjkang0424/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Empirical_Asset_Pricing_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb)**: Predict S&P 500 excess return by feeding 6 interest rate related characteristics and 7 primary stock characteristics. Apply different machine learning methods to select the model with best accuracy. 
   - Lasso regression, Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Ridge regression, Long Short Term Memory, Ordinary Least Squares  
 
 - **[Prediction of PUBG Winning Placement](https://github.com/hjkang0424/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/PUBG_Winning_Placement_Prediction.ipynb)** : Predict players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1(first place) to 0(last place) using player features data such as number of kills, type of weapon used, walking distance, and so on.    
    - Linear regression, Principal Component Analysis, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
    
- **[Comparative Analysis of iPhone 12 vs. Galaxy S20 Release Sentiments in Twitter](https://github.com/hjkang0424/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/IPhone_Sentiment_Analsis_Complete.ipynb)**: Use tweets from Twitter to compare and analyze the sentiments and public views of iPhone 12 and Galaxy S20. 
   - Sentiment Analysis using VADER, Frequency Analysis, Wordcloud 
 
 - **[Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with Machine Learning Approaches](https://github.com/hjkang0424/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction_wMachine_Learning.ipynb)** : Make use of bike sharing data to identify any patterns and use different algorithms to build models to predict the demand of bike sharing. Find the best performing model for prediction of bike sharing demand using empirical datasets
   - Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, K nearest neighbors, Decision Tree regression
  
 - **[Tree-like Topology Reconstruction Using Link Prediction Methods](https://github.com/hjkang0424/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Tree-like_Device_Topology_Reconstruction_Link_Prediction.ipynb)** : Link prediction on Huawei's tree-like mobile broadband topology dataset to find missing edges between routers and base station through the microwave
   - SEAL, Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network, node2vec with logistic regression, node2vec with Light GBM
  
  
### 2. Database management (SQL)
  - **[Information Management system of School](https://hyohyokang.tistory.com/5)** : Design an information management system of school by doing the following : 
    - Design an ER Diagram
    - Write a schema
    - Database creation using SQL
    - Normalization
